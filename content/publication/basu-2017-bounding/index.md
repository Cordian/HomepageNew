abstract: Let R be a real closed field. The problem of obtaining tight bounds on
  the Betti numbers of semi-algebraic subsets of in terms of the number and
  degrees of the defining polynomials has been an important problem in real
  algebraic geometry with the first results due to Oleĭnik and Petrovskiĭ, Thom
  and Milnor. These bounds are all exponential in the number of variables k.
  Motivated by several applications in real algebraic geometry, as well as in
  theoretical computer science, where such bounds have found applications, we
  consider in this paper the problem of bounding the equivariant Betti numbers
  of symmetric algebraic and semi-algebraic subsets of . We obtain several
  asymptotically tight upper bounds. In particular, we prove that if is a
  semi-algebraic subset defined by a finite set of s symmetric polynomials of
  degree at most $d$, then the sum of the -equivariant Betti numbers of $S$ with
  coefficients in is bounded by . Unlike the classical bounds on the ordinary
  Betti numbers of real algebraic varieties and semi-algebraic sets, the above
  bound is polynomial in k when the degrees of the defining polynomials are
  bounded by a constant. As an application we improve the best known bound on
  the ordinary Betti numbers of the projection of a compact algebraic set
  improving for any fixed degree the best previously known bound for this
  problem due to Gabrielov, Vorobjov and Zell.
