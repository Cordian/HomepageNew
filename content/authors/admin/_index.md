I am a professor of mathematics at UiT The Arctic University of Norway. I am currently also acting as Pro Dean for PhD education at the Faculty of Science and Technology. 

My research interests include real algebraic geometry, optimization, computational complexity, and computer algebra. I am leading the  [Algebra group](https://uit.no/research/algebra) and I am also one of the initiators of the [Lie-Størmer Center](https://uit.no/research/lsc) for Fundamental Structures in Computational and Pure Mathematics.
